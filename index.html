Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all</p>

                    Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet.

                </p><p class="blog-text">The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long time since 1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first introduced by Milton Friedman, an American economist, and statistician who strongly believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among college graduates.

                    So, what is this Income Share Agreement?

                    Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how efficiently (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.
                    
                    Some of the tasks that can be solved by implementing Machine Learning include:
