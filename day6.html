     <h2>Dosa</h2>
     <div style="width:1200px;height: 500px;text-align: justify;"
    <p> 
       Dosa is a popular South Indian dish made from fermented batter consisting of rice and black gram (also known as urad dal). The batter is spread thin on
       a hot griddle or flat pan and cooked until crispy on one side, then flipped and cooked on the other side. The resulting thin, crepe-like pancake is usually
       served with a variety of chutneys, sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew), and/or potato masala. Dosas are often eaten for breakfast, but they can be enjoyed
       at any time of day. They are a staple food in South Indian cuisine, and there are many different variations of dosas, including masala dosa (filled with a 
       spiced potato mixture), rava dosa (made with semolina instead of rice), and many more. Dosas are known for their crisp texture and tangy flavor, thanks to 
       the fermentation process. They are also a good source of carbohydrates and protein, making them a nutritious and satisfying meal. Dosas have gained popularity
       worldwide and can now be found in many Indian restaurants around the world.</p>
